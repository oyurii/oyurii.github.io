# Yurii Ovcharenko

Hello! My name is **Yurii Ovcharenko**. I am a **physicist, educator, and researcher** specializing in **computer modeling of physical processes in metal alloys**, particularly those used in **nuclear reactor materials**.

## About Me

I currently work as a **Senior Researcher** at the **Institute of Applied Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine**. The institute is a leading scientific center for applied and fundamental research focused on nuclear technologies and the study of the structure and composition of matter.

In addition to my research activities, I teach the graduate-level course  
**“Molecular Dynamics and Ab Initio Modeling in Materials Science”** at the institute.

## Academic and Teaching Experience

Previously, I served as an **Associate Professor** at the **Department of General and Theoretical Physics** at **Sumy State University**, where I taught the following courses:

- Quantum Mechanics  
- Statistical Physics  
- Solid State Physics  

I hold a **PhD in Physics and Mathematics** (major: **Solid State Physics**) and the academic title of **Associate Professor** in Theoretical Physics. During my work at Sumy State University, I conducted experimental research on the **electrophysical properties of thin multilayer metal and semiconductor films**.

## Research Interests

- Molecular dynamics simulations  
- *Ab initio* modeling  
- Solid state physics  
- Radiation-resistant materials  
- Metal alloys for nuclear applications  
- Computational materials science
